# How browser works step by step ?
## Web Browser?
A web browser, often known as an Internet browser, is a piece of software that enables access to the World Wide Web. The content on the internet, including as web pages, photographs, videos, documents, and other files, can be found, fetched, and shown using this method.
## Web browser components
The front end and back end are the two components of every web browser. The front-end is the user interface that we use, and it appears to be very straightforward. However, a browser's intricate back end is what makes it possible for it to work as it does. The following are the principal elements of a browser:

## 1.User Interface
The area where you work with the browser is called the interface. The section that displays the web page, the bookmarks button, and all other options on the browser screen are followed by the address bar and on-screen controls like home, back, forward, and refresh.

## 2.Browser Engine
The browser engine functions as a link between the rendering engine and the user interface. It queries and modifies the rendering engine based on the inputs from various user interfaces.

## 3.Rendering Engine
The requested web page is displayed on the browser screen by the rendering engine. A web page is a document that is typically written in HTML; a rendering engine transforms this document and its data into a format that users can comprehend and access the website, image, or video they are looking for.

To create the layout seen in the user interface, it works with HTML, XML, and other files. With the aid of some plugins and extensions, the rendering engine can also operate with various sorts of data. The main web browsers' rendering engines are listed below:

* **Blink**    - Microsoft Edge, Opera, and Google Chrome (previously used EdgeHTML).
* **Webkit**   - safari uses.
* **Gecko**  - Firefox uses Gecko.
* **Trident** - Internet Explorer uses Trident.

## 4.Networking
Internet connectivity and security are handled by the networking component. Using widely used internet protocols like HTML and FTP, it obtains the URLs.

## 5.JavaScript Interpreter
The JavaScript Interpreter, as the name implies, interprets and runs JavaScript code that has been integrated into a website. The rendering engine is then used to display the results.

## 6.UI Backend
Basic widgets like a choose box, input box, window, check box, etc. can be drawn with the aid of the UI Backend. For the same, it makes use of the user interface techniques included into the operating system.

## 7.Data Storage
All of the browser's data, including Cookies, Local Storage, Session Storage, IndexedDB, WebSQL, and FileSystem, are kept in this unified layer.

# Working of the Browser Step by Step:
Every time you click on a link or type in a URL, the browser sends and receives data to and from other areas of the web. The rendering engine converts the information it receives into a format that is simple to grasp. The user interface then shows it.

It involves a multi-step process including DNS resolution, HTTP exchange between browser and web server, rendering, and so on, as follows:

1. You enter a URL in the web browser.
2. The browser finds the IP address for the domain using DNS.
3. The browser initiates a connection with the server.
4. Next, it sends an HTTP request to the webserver.
5. The server handles the request and sends out an HTTP response.
6. The browser renders and displays the HTML content, i.e., the web page.

# Terminology Explained

* **Cookies –** Cookies are the small pieces of data websites store on your device’s storage.

* **DNS –** DNS or Domain Name System is the database that contains records of the domains. It helps discover websites using human-readable addresses.

* **IP Address –**  It identifies the location of a specific server that’s connected to the internet. Each website has its own unique IP address and can have multiple IP addresses when hosted at multiple locations. For example, a common IP address for Facebook is 157.240.241.35.

* **HTTP –** HTTP is a protocol that allows the fetching of resources, like HTML documents. It is a client-server protocol, which means your web browser initiates requests.

* **HTML –**  HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language, used for creating web pages and applications.

* **URL –** Universal Resource Locator is the address of a given unique resource on the Web.
